# Skills experiments

Runtime records for [skills/0001](0001-dispatch.md) and the later skills findings (plan 0045 Phase 2). Harness and
evidence rules: ADR-0003, ADR-0004, ADR-0011, ADR-0013, ADR-0014;
[tooling](../../../.claude/skills/reverser/references/tooling.md),
[harness-play](../../../.claude/skills/reverser/references/harness-play.md).

Plan 0045 Phase 2's harness runs: none yet. Plan 0046's emulated runs (ADR-0015) follow.

## run:2026-10-20-cat-emu-9a

- **Question:** (plan 0046 Phase 1, batch 9a) Do the missile server do functions 2, 6–12 and 14–18 map their inputs
  (the missile's record, `MissileData` words, owner, path and seed) to the arguments of the calls they end in, and to
  the bytes and seed they write before them, exactly as [skills/0004](0004-missile-do-1-18.md) §§ 3–11 say?
- **Setup:** Ghidra 12.1.2 p-code emulator (`EmulatorHelper`) on the pinned `game.exe` (lane copy
  `GHIDRA_PROJ_DIR=workspace/ghidra-p46m1`, symbols replayed from `re/symbols.csv`, heap 3 GB, under
  `systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryMax=4G`). No wine, nothing runs natively, no slot. New script
  `re/ghidra_scripts/EmuBoundary.java` (`286393aa…`, `tools/ghidra.sh emuboundary`): `EmuTrace.java` plus `observe
  <addr>` lines in the memory spec; a case that reaches one ends there and prints its registers and the 64 bytes at
  ESP (skills/0004 § 2). Models, case writers and checks: `tools/skills_catalogue_emu.py` (`b2a6afd8…`, which uses
  `tools/rng.py` and `tools/sweep_s4b.py`'s image reader). All inputs synthetic (stock parameter values among them);
  every case-writer draw from `random.Random("cat9a-<family>")`. Files in `workspace/logs/skills-cat-9a/`,
  `manifest.sha256` `58e190a9…` (48 files: cases, memory specs, expected inputs, outputs, the empty `.err` logs,
  `check.txt` `3e1f2587…`, `static.txt` `e2b2f9a1…`, `rows.txt` `6cfad638…`); `sha256sum -c manifest.sha256` from that
  directory passes.
- **Procedure:**
  ```
  D=workspace/logs/skills-cat-9a
  python3 -I tools/skills_catalogue_emu.py cases
  for f in cellsub orb spiral scatter chest homing periodic sublob guided; do
    GHIDRA_PROJ_DIR=workspace/ghidra-p46m1 GHIDRA_HEADLESS_MAXMEM=3G systemd-run --user --scope -q -p MemoryMax=4G \
      tools/ghidra.sh emuboundary $D/$f.cases $D/$f.mem > $D/$f.out 2> $D/$f.err
  done
  python3 -I tools/skills_catalogue_emu.py check  > $D/check.txt
  python3 -I tools/skills_catalogue_emu.py static > $D/static.txt
  python3 -I tools/skills_catalogue_emu.py manifest --write
  ```
  Each memory spec points `g_pDataTables` at a scratch DataTables written one field per field read, names the nine
  boundaries (`observe`) and guards the allocator and fatal-path entries; each case writes only the fields its
  function reads, so any other read is traced.
- **Observed** (`check.txt`):
  ```
  CAT9A cellsub  cases=1800 match=1800 bad=0 neg=173 traced=2   undeclared=0 stopped=0
  CAT9A orb      cases=1500 match=1500 bad=0 neg=266 traced=130 undeclared=0 stopped=0
  CAT9A spiral   cases=1500 match=1500 bad=0 neg=223 traced=0   undeclared=0 stopped=0
  CAT9A scatter  cases=2400 match=2400 bad=0 neg=394 traced=4   undeclared=0 stopped=0
  CAT9A chest    cases=1500 match=1500 bad=0 neg=247 traced=1   undeclared=0 stopped=0
  CAT9A homing   cases=1500 match=1500 bad=0 neg=22  traced=3   undeclared=0 stopped=0
  CAT9A periodic cases=1200 match=1200 bad=0 neg=149 traced=0   undeclared=0 stopped=0
  CAT9A sublob   cases=1200 match=1200 bad=0 neg=187 traced=4   undeclared=0 stopped=0
  CAT9A guided   cases=1200 match=1200 bad=0 neg=128 traced=79  undeclared=0 stopped=0
  CAT9A static   data_stores=0 pins=18 pins_ok=18 ro_reads=3
  ```
  (`traced` counts aggregated rows of declared image reads; the branches reached are on each family's `outcomes`
  line.) Development runs before the final declared sets: the first `check` listed three undeclared image reads (the
  `CALC_Eval` jump table, `UNIT_GetSizeX`'s jump table, a target's `+0xC6`), each then declared or written by the case
  writer; the outputs above are from the final case files.
- **Conclusion:** bit-exact reproduction (evidence rule 4, ADR-0015) of the 13 functions' maps up to their boundary
  calls, 13 800 cases, 0 mismatches; supports skills/0004 §§ 3–11 (do 7's re-plan and do 13 not covered).
  *Architect ruling (`lane/p46m1` review, 2026-10-20):* the `observe` boundary does not meet ADR-0015 (1) and (3) as
  written; the proposed [ADR-0021](../../adrs/0021-observed-boundaries-in-emulation.md) admits it. Until the owner
  accepts it, the statements that rest on cases ending at a boundary are `[I]`; the refusal paths that return are `[C]`
  (skills/0004 § 2). The review checked the call site of every observed boundary from the kept outputs
  (`workspace/logs/skills-cat-9a-review/callsites.txt` `8ea8058b…`: one site per function and boundary). Not covered: what any
  boundary callee does; faults (§ 1); when the game runs these functions or with which seed.
